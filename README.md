This will be updated soon.

You'll want to run `npm install` within the root folder.

Next, you'll want to `cd` into `/client` and run another `npm install`.

You'll need to create two terminal tabs, one for the electron back end and another for the front end to spin up the node server.

In order to start the electron app, run `electron .` in the root of the project terminal tab.

Please view `/client` readme located [https://github.com/pixelcure/crypto-watcher-electron/blob/master/client/README.md](here)
