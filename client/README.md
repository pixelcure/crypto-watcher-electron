## DEPLOYMENT

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder and pushes the website to [https://aerobatic.io](https://aerobatic.io) for hosting.
This will only work if you have the `aerobatic` cli tool installed (`npm install aerobatic-cli -g`). 
You will also need the correct admin access to deploy.
